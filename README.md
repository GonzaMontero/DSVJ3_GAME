# **Devils Domain**

The game is a Gacha/Hero collector, in which you are a demon king who wants to dominate the planet. For that purpose, you will have to gather allies and make them stronger battling against enemies as you progress through the different levels. You also have your throne room, which can be used to acquire gems, which will be needed to obtain more playable characters.
